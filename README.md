# ios-linechart
Interactive linecharts for the simplicity-loving iOS developer.

You just want some linecharts, and Core Plot makes you think

![fuuu](doc/rage.png)

Search no more! ios-linechart is here!

## Features
- Simple API. Lets you draw the first chart by the time you would need to find sample code for Core Plot.
- Interactivity. Lets users look at single datapoints.
- Support non-uniform steps on the x axis

## Installation

### CocoaPods
The best way to get ios-linechart is to use [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/). 

### Without CocoaPods

If, for some reason, you don't want that, copy the following files into your project:

* `LegendView.h`, `LegendView.m`
* `LineChartView.h`, `LineChartView.m`
* `InfoView.h`, `InfoView.m`

Additionally, you will need to get some dependencies from the [objc-utils](https://github.com/mruegenberg/objc-utils) project:

* `UIKit+DrawingHelpers.{h,m}` (found in `UIKit/Drawing/`)

Just copy these into you project as well.

ios-linechart uses Core Graphics, so you'll need to add `CoreGraphics.framework` to your project.



## Usage

Basic usage can be seen in the demo app contained in the repository.

First, import the main header:

```obj-c
    #import "LineChartView.h"
```
    
Each chart line is contained in a `LineChartData` object, which specifies a range of its data on the x axis (`xMin` / `xMax`), a `color`, a `title` (which is displayed in the legend) and an `itemCount`, the number of data points:

```obj-c
    LineChartData *d = [LineChartData new];
    d.xMin = 1;
    d.xMax = 31;
    d.title = @"The title for the legend";
    d.color = [UIColor redColor];
    d.itemCount = 10;
```
    
Additionally, each `LineChartData` object also has a `getData` property. This is simply a block that takes the number of a data point as its     argument and returns `LineChartDataItem` objects, which wrap the individual data points:

```obj-c
    NSMutableArray *vals = [NSMutableArray new];
    for(NSUInteger i = 0; i < d.itemCount; ++i)
        [vals addObject:@((rand() / (float)RAND_MAX) * (31 - 1) + 1)];
    [vals sortUsingComparator:^NSComparisonResult(id obj1, id obj2) {
        return [obj1 compare:obj2];
    }];
    d.getData = ^(NSUInteger item) {
        float x = [vals[item] floatValue];
        float y = powf(2, x / 7);
        NSString *label1 = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%d", item];
        NSString *label2 = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%f", y];
        return [LineChartDataItem dataItemWithX:x y:y xLabel:label1 dataLabel:label2];
    };
```
    
The `x` and `y` properties of `LineChartDataItem` are, obviously, the x and y values of the data point. `xLabel` is the text displayed on the x axis when the data point is selected, `dataLabel` is usually just a textual representation of the y value, and is displayed in a bubble directly next to the data point when the user touches it.

Note that, to get a coherent chart, the x values for the items should be sorted. This will be the case anyway for most real-world data. 

Finally, everything is packed up into a `LineChartView`:

```obj-c
    LineChartView *chartView = [[LineChartView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(20, 700, 500, 300)];
    chartView.yMin = 0;
    chartView.yMax = powf(2, 31 / 7) + 0.5;
    chartView.ySteps = @[@"0.0",
                         [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%.02f", chartView.yMax / 2],
                         [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%.02f", chartView.yMax]];
    chartView.data = @[d];

    [self.view addSubview:chartView];
```
    
The `yMin` and `yMax` properties should be self-evident. `ySteps` is an array of labels which are placed along the y axis. `data` is an array of all `LineChartData` objects to use. `drawsDataPointOrnaments` is a switch that determines whether circles are drawn around the actual data points.
